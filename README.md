# Wavelength to sRGB
A few functions for converting from wavelength (nm) to sRGB

# Background
  The CIE, or Commission Internationale de lâ€™Eclairage, 
  has quantative data for the subjective realm of color
  perception. This data can be used to map a wavelength 
  of light to a sRGB color space, among other uses. In
  this program there are two functions for approximating 
  RGB colors from a wavelength.
